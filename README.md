# DeepStaking

DeepStaking is a decentralized application (dApp) designed for staking on the Ethereum blockchain. This project utilizes modern tools and frameworks to provide a robust and efficient staking platform.

## Features

- **Frontend:** Built with React and Vite for a fast and responsive user interface.
- **Smart Contracts:** Developed using Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Local Development:** Uses Foundry, a modular toolkit for Ethereum application development, which includes tools like Forge, Cast, Anvil, and Chisel.

- **Reward System:** Users can claim rewards and live track each reward they earn.
